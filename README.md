# Dictionary-Compose
I'm trying to learn Jetpack Compose and Caching. This is my first time I use Declarative UI and I know Declarative UI going to be a thing in the future. 
It's a bit confusing for me when using it, perhaps XML is my comfort zone for now. I can't wait for Jetpack Compose become stable, because the simplicity when you write a code.
For example is Recyclerview, you don't have to create Adapter to insert the data. That's really helpful and easier to maintain the Recyclerview.
